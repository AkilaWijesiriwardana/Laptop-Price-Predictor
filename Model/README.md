# 💻 Laptop Price Predictor

This project is a Laptop Price Predictor that uses machine learning (Random Forest Algorithm) to estimate the price of a laptop based on its specifications. The model was trained on a dataset containing details such as brand, type, processor, RAM, GPU, display features, and weight. It follows a complete ML pipeline including data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
